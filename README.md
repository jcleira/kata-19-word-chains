This repository contains my personal [kata19 Word Chains](http://codekata.com/kata/kata19-word-chains/) implementation.

## Initial planning 

After reading the kata, I realised that this kata were not going to be as easy as others.

I've wrote some services that used a graph database (neo4j) and this "linked" words problem did recall on me traversal search. 

I think that I would enjoy creating some "linked" word nodes and perform concurrency traversal search on them.
